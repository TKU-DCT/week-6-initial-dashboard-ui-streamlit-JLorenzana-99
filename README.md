# Week 6 – Initial Dashboard UI (Streamlit)

## 🎯 Objective

This week, you'll begin building a simple **web-based dashboard** for your data center monitor using **Streamlit**.  
You will read system metrics from `log.csv` and display them in a dashboard format with tables and charts.

---

## 🧠 Reminder: Where does `log.csv` come from?

Your `log.csv` file should already exist from **Week 4 or Week 5**.  
It contains fields like:  
`Timestamp, CPU, Memory, Disk, Ping_Status, Ping_ms`

If you **don’t have one**, you can generate it by re-running your previous logger script (e.g., from Week 5):

``bash
python main.py

This will log 5 entries with system info and create log.csv.

Alternatively, you can use the example below.

🧪 Sample log.csv (Optional)
